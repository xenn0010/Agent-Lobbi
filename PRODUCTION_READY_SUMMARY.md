- Staging deployment
- Performance testing
- Production deployment with health checks
```

### ⚙️ Configuration
```bash
# Environment variables for all settings
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...
REDIS_URL=redis://...
ENABLE_MONITORING=true
LOAD_BALANCER_STRATEGY=performance_based
```

## 🎯 MVP Capabilities Achieved

### ✅ Core Requirements Met
1. **N-to-N Agent Communication**: ✅ WORKING
2. **Load Balancing**: ✅ WORKING  
3. **Database Integration**: ✅ WORKING
4. **Monitoring Stack**: ✅ WORKING
5. **Error Recovery**: ✅ WORKING
